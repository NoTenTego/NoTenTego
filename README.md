<p>Before we begin, I want to mention that I'm not particularly fond of sharing a lot of code on GitHub, so you won't find a extensive collection of projects here. However, I do have a few smaller projects available on my public repository. &#x1F4BB;</p>

<h1>Background</h1>
<p>As a web developer, I have acquired a solid skill set in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing me to create engaging web applications. In addition, I have spent several years learning Lua as a hobby, primarily utilizing it within the Multi Theft Auto (MTA) environment. However, my current focus is dedicated entirely to advancing my knowledge of JavaScript and its associated frameworks. &#x1F4DA;

For example, one of my MTA:SA Lua scripts: https://streamable.com/2hh9ve https://streamable.com/udzsz8
